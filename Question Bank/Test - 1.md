Read all the questions carefully ..
##### Lab Practices will helps you give better understanding of the logic
  
### Questions (Subjectives)



#### 1.Discuss about vectors in R with examples.

```
Hint: Use R- command for example.
```

#### 2. write a short note on the mentioned below questions.

##### a) List the data structures in R.
##### b) Write syntax of if else in R. 
##### c) Write any 3 math functions in R. 
##### d)  Define mean, median, mode and standard deviation. 


#### 3. Explain Data Types in R with the help of a reference example.

#### 4. Write R code to tabulate a function 
```
f(x)=3x 2 +2x+1 in the interval (-1,1) in steps of 0.2 3. 

```
#### 5. Demonstrate that  How to pass default values for arguments in R.

#### 6. Explain the control structures in R with brief examples.

#### 7. Explain in detail about dataframe and arrays with example R code.

#### 11. Write R code to the function by using if else command

```
f(x) = x if x<1/2
= (1-x) if 1/2<x<1
= 0 otherwise 
```
#### 12. Given 3 linear equations
```
5x1-x2+3x3=7

```
a = (5, 10, 15, 20, ..., 160) b = (87, 86, 85, ..., 56) Use vector arithmetic to multiply these vectors and call the result ‘d’. 

```
#### 14. Select subsets of d to identify the following.

```
i. What are the 19th, 20th, and 21st elements of d?
ii. What are all of the elements of d which are less than 2000?
iii. How many elements of d are greater than 6000?
